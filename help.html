                  What is the network load and how to increase the transaction
                  rate?

              <div class="item-help-tabs__text">
                Network load is the set of transactions in a blockchain that are waiting to be confirmed due to low
                fees, increased load and other factors. The system is kept running by miners, who use processing power
                to process transactions and find the necessary hash for the transaction. Transactions with a higher
                commission are processed first, then miners are accepted for transactions with a lower premium. That's
                how the queue is formed, with the more profitable transactions in the "head" and the payments with the
                minimum premium in the "tail".If the sender needs a fast transfer, he sets a higher premium, which
                ensures that the transaction is included in the block without delays. With savings on fees, a new
                transaction can take up to 3 days or more. When you create a request on our website, you will be able to
                see the recommended network fee. This commission will increase the chance of a transaction being
                confirmed soon.

                We want to inform you about changes in the rules of our exchange service. If we received money from a
                card different from the verified card, your application will not be processed. Funds will be returned
                to the card within 24 hours (24 hours), it will also be necessary to pass verification from the card
                from which the funds were received.
                Also, if you choose the Yandex Money direction and send funds from a third-party bank, then such
                applications are not processed, the funds will be returned to the client within 24 hours, the
                commission is at the client’s expense.

              <div class="item-help-tabs__text">
                MEMO is a special identifier used in XRP transactions. In Stellar, the target tag is called memo. Many
                services, including Freewallet, have one XRP and XLM address for all customers. The only difference is
                a special set of numbers, called a destination tag, unique to each user. When you are asked to enter a
                tag or note, do not ignore this action! Otherwise, your funds will be lost and sent to the general
                balance of the platform, but not to your account. Imagine the tag as the number of your house on a long
                street. You need to know the exact building number in order for the package to reach its final
                destination. The same goes for these coins.
                If you use a personal wallet, using TAG or MEMO is optional. In case you deposit funds on the exchange,
                TAG or MEMO is mandatory.

                correctly:
                1. Check that your details for the transfer are correct (wallet, account or card). If you made a mistake

                receive a letter in the mail with a description of the reason. If the funds at your request were sent to

                the data you specify;
                2. Check if funds have been debited from your account. If we do not see the transfer of funds from you,
                then the application will be deleted.
                3. In rare cases, it is possible to change the time of the transfer by the bank or the payment system.

                Card verification is a procedure that increases the security of your personal data inside our exchange
                service. To verify the card, you must upload a photo of a bank card in the background of our site.
                1. Photo must be in jpeg / png format and not exceed 5 MB in size
                2. The photo should be on the background of our site, where the application number is also visible
                3. Card details must be clearly visible, otherwise the verification will be rejected. You can close the
                second or third block of four digits
                4. If you do not have the opportunity to photograph the map on the background of our site, you can write
                to us in the chat. The operator will tell you.
                5. Online card verification is not possible!
                After verifying the card, you will be able to make applications using this card in 3 clicks. </div>
