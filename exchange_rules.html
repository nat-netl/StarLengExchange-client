                procedure for changing the rate in the request:<br />
              <ul class="item-help-tabs__items-content-list">
                <li>
                  The rate shall be established for 10 minutes upon
                  choosing the exchange type; after the expiration of the time, a new rate will be offered
                  automatically;
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the User managed to issue the Request within 10 minutes, then this rate shall be
                  extended for another 15 minutes to complete the request payment. If the User did not manage to make a
                  payment and change the request status to "Paid" by clicking on the "I paid" button, then after the
                  expiration of the time, a new exchange rate shall be automatically offered;
                </li>

                <li>
                  The Service shall
                  reserve the right to unilaterally change the exchange rate if more than 8 hours have passed since the

                  the digital currency network;
                </li>

                <li>
                  The Service shall reserve the right to unilaterally change the
                  exchange rate if the request contains an error due to the User's fault, and the User has not provided
                  correct information to the Service's e-mail within 8 hours;
                </li>

                  The Service shall reserve the right to
                  unilaterally change the exchange rate if the original rate has changed by more than 1% before the
                  request is paid and the request status is changed to "Paid".
                </li>
              </ul>

              force.<br />3.9. In case of termination hereof, money or digital currencies received after the above
              period, at the request of the User, shall be refunded to the User details used to send money. When

              they arose through no fault of the Service.<br />3.13. If the exchange rate increases by more than 1%,
              all money that have not been claimed for more than a day and received in favor of the Service shall be
              subject to exchange or refund at the rate established at the time the request was issued.<br />3.14. The
